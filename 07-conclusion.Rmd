# Conclusion

App Stores operate in a multisided market. With a rapidly increasing number of apps, software developers face the challenge of satisfying consumers' ever-rising and changing expectations. In this project, we narrow our focus on Android and Apple iOS, the two most used app store worldwide, and mainly investigate user price sensitivity and user income distribution for these two app stores across countries. We show that while owning an iPhone seems to be a strong indicator of higher income, this is more likely to be a geo-specific trend in North America given Apple's brand power, and Android app store gains dominance in countries such as India, South Korea, and Russia. In the second part, we focus on analysis about gender-neutral categories and explore the distribution of user demographic information such as age, nationality, and years of education. While we do observe some cultural difference in downloads for gender-neutral categories, user persona in terms of age and educational background for gender-neutral apps are very similar in general.
