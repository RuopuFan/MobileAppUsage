### EDAV Final Project - Group12

In this project, we will carry out analysis based on the [Worldwide Mobile App User Behavior Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27459), published by Harvard Dataverse. The dataset contains 10,208 unique observations and collects responses of 30 survey questions from participants from more than 15 countries in 2014. Data includes respondentsâ€™ demographic information such as age, gender, marital status, nationality, country of residence, ethnicity, years of education, occupation, and annual income range, etc. The survey also asked a series of questions regarding app usage behavior such as the type of app store (IOS vs Android) used, frequency of visiting app store, monthly downloads, monthly
spending on apps, reasons for using/ not using an app, etc.

We will use the data to explore the following questions:

1. Can we observe any difference in price sensitivity and income distribution for users from different app stores (e.g. iOS vs Android)?

2. What categories are more male-/female-dominated? What are some of the gender-neutral categories? How are they connected with the user's age, occupation, nationality, and educational background?

3. For price-sensitive users and those who are not, what are the distributions of annual income? What makes them decide to download and make in-app purchases?
