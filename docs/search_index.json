Mobile users now can access a variety of applications including the popular ones like Social Networking, Games, Utilities, etc. Due to the impact of COVID-19, people tend to use social media and other applications to connect through the internet even more, which results in a surge in downloading of apps and increasing user activity overall. In this project, we will carry out analysis based on the Worldwide Mobile App User Behavior Dataset, published by Harvard Dataverse. This dataset is collected from a global mobile app usage survey with 10,208 responses. Questions cover from the respondents app usage habits to demographic information. We will visualize the data and discuss our findings on the following questions: Can we observe any difference in price sensitivity and income distribution for users from different app stores (e.g. iOS vs Android)? What categories are more male-/female-dominated? What are some of the gender-neutral categories? How are they connected with the users age, nationality, and educational background? For price-sensitive users and those who are not, what are the distributions of annual income? What makes them decide to download and make in-app purchases? Analysis related to the above questions will be presented in the following chapters. To access the codes and other details, please see our github repository at MobileAppUsage.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The Worldwide Mobile App User Behavior Dataset contains cross-country user behavior data collected through a survey conducted by Lim et al. for their research paper, Investigating Country Differences in Mobile App User Behavior and Challenges for Software Engineering, aiming to investigate the relationship between app user behavior and the country demographic. The dataset is made public and stored in Harvard Dataverse Repository, an open data repository organized by the Harvard community. The survey collected responses from 10,208 participants spanning more than 15 countries, including the United States of America, China, Japan, Germany, France, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy, Russian Federation, India, Canada, Spain, Australia, Mexico, and Republic of Korea. The questionnaire is threefold with 31 questions in total: the first part focuses on user behavior in terms of mobile app usage; the second part asks individual demographic information such as gender, age, and household income, etc; the third part is centered around user personality based on the Big Five personality traits. A more detailed description about the attributes included in this dataset is as following: Dataset: mobile_app_user_dataset.xlsx Link to Harvard Dataverse Repository: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml;jsessionid=c4428c7c612c7607165aa4d0ebde?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2F27459&amp;version=&amp;q=&amp;fileAccess=&amp;fileTag=%22dataset%22&amp;fileSortField=name&amp;fileSortOrder=desc Table 2.1: Column Description ï Column Name Description ID Unique ID for each participant StartDate Date and time the participant started this survey EndDate Date and time the participant completed this survey Response Status Response status: incomplete/complete/screened out/bad data Participant Type ours/panel Q1_1 Browser type Q1_2 Browser version Q1_3 Browser operating system Q1_4 Browser screen resolution Q1_5 Browser flash version Q1_6 Browser Java support Q1_7 Browser user agent Q2 Binary indicator of whether the respondent has a mobile device Q3_1 Mobile device manufacturer Q3_2 Mobile device model Q3_3 Binary indicator of whether the respondent use apps Q4_1 Type of app store Q4_2 Binary indicator of whether the respondent knows which app store he/she is using Q5 Frequency that the respondent visits app store to look for apps Q6 Amount of app downloads per month Q7 Under what situation does the respondent look for apps Q8 Ways to find apps Q9 Things to consider before downloading Q10 Purpose of downloading Q11 Reasons for spending money on apps Q12_1 Maximum spending on an app Q12_2 Name of the app that the respondent has spent the most Q12_3 Reasons for downloading the app that the respondent has spent the most Q12_4 Best/worst featue of the app that the respondent has spent the most Q12_5 Average spending on apps per month Q13 Reasons for rating apps Q14 Reasons for stopping use an app Q15 Type of downloaded app Q16 Respondents gender Q17 Respondents age Q18 Respondents marital status Q19 Respondents nationality Q20 Respondents country of residence Q21 Respondents first language Q22 Respondents ethnicity Q23 Respondents highest level of education Q24 Respondents years of education Q25 Wether the respondent has a disability Q26 Respondents current employment status Q27 Respondents occupation Q28 Currency of household income Q29 Annual household income Q30 Personality traits Issue with this dataset: this survey is self-reported and therefore, might be subjected and be influenced by factors such as individual experience and cultural background. Besides, many answers provided by participants are not exact but mostly approximations. For example, users might be unaware of the exact number of apps downloaded per month and use an approximation instead.

We keep NAs for now and will explore the missing values in the next section. For the levels of HH.Income column, authors of this survey already divided data into 12 intervals to address the problem of inconsistent income levels in different countries (1 for the lowest, 11 for the highest financial level and 12 for Prefer not to say). We therefore decide to not convert these currencies into a uniform unit and to go with the original income numbers. We will explain in detail in the results part. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Column pattern 4.2 Value patterns 4.3 Missing values by variable", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this section, we will look at the patterns in missing data. We expect to have many missing values in this Mobile App User Dataset as the data are collected from a survey where respondents may skip questions that they prefer not to answer. 4.1 Column pattern ## PriceSensitive Education YearsEdu Occupation Gender ## 7104 4892 4892 4892 4842 ## Age Nationality AppStore ## 4842 4842 2310 Here, we define PriceSensitive as people who took price into consideration when choosing apps to download (those who chose Price in Q9). On the other hand, NAs in this column represent people who skipped the question or those who didnt choose Price for the question. In addition to 7,104 missing values in PriceSensitive, 4,892 people didnt reply to education, years of education and occupation, while 4,842 values are missing for gender, age and nationalities. It also shows that 2,310 people skipped the question of which app store do you use? in the survey. 4.2 Value patterns 4.2.1 Missing values by app store ## # A tibble: 11 x 7 ## AppStore Gender Age Nationality Education YearsEdu Occupation ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 iOS 106 106 106 113 113 113 ## 2 Do not use apps 24 24 24 24 24 24 ## 3 Blackberry 28 28 28 35 35 35 ## 4 Android 167 167 167 181 181 181 ## 5 Nokia 102 102 102 105 105 105 ## 6 Samsung 76 76 76 80 80 80 ## 7 Windows 23 23 23 23 23 23 ## 8 None 1595 1595 1595 1595 1595 1595 ## 9 Not sure 390 390 390 403 403 403 ## 10 Other 21 21 21 23 23 23 ## 11 &lt;NA&gt; 2310 2310 2310 2310 2310 2310 When we group the data by different App stores, some missing data appear to be highly correlated: Gender, Age and Nationality share the same patterns of missing values, while Education, YearsEdu and Occupation have exact same numbers of NAs in each App store. This shows that respondents who didnt answer education-related questions also skipped the one for occupation. People who prefer not to answer their genders and ages avoided answering nationalities too. If we visualize missing values of Education by App store, we can see that the largest number of NAs in education appears in the group NA in App store. We should consider removing these NAs since they have little information for both variables. 4.2.2 Missing values by app store &amp; price sensitivity ## # A tibble: 11 x 4 ## AppStore num_appstore num_na pct_na ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; 2310 2310 1 ## 2 None 1653 1633 0.99 ## 3 Do not use apps 76 67 0.88 ## 4 Not sure 737 608 0.82 ## 5 Nokia 830 438 0.53 ## 6 Other 150 78 0.52 ## 7 Samsung 722 357 0.49 ## 8 Android 2066 990 0.48 ## 9 Windows 162 72 0.44 ## 10 iOS 1169 428 0.37 ## 11 Blackberry 333 123 0.37 All people who skipped writing down their App stores have an NA in PriceSensitive. People using iOS (Apple Store) appear to have the smallest number of missing values for the price question, so they are the most price-sensitive. We can also see that Android/Google and Samsung market users have similar percentages of NAs. 4.3 Missing values by variable The most obvious pattern is the complete case (no NA in any column), indicating that over 2,500 observations contain all the information we need. The second most frequent missing pattern appears in the PriceSensitive column. It is interesting that many people didnt provide any of their personal information in the survey, as we can see from the third, fourth &amp; fifth patterns. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Analysis 1 5.2 Analysis 2 5.3 Analysis 3", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Analysis 1 The bar chart displays the number of users for different app store. After filtering out users who dont have (or use) app store or didnt answer the question in the questionnaire, we can see that among all respondents, most users use Android app store, followed by Apple iOS, Nokia, Samsung, Blackberry, Windows, and some other app stores. The distribution of user count, in general, follows the global smartphone market share. Interestingly, quite a lot of users answered Not sure for the type of app store in this survey, and this might be due to the fact that some mobile devices support a number of operating systems or issue with rebranding (e.g. Android Market has been rebranded as Google Play) as pointed out by Lim et al in their paper Investigating Country Differences in Mobile App User Behavior and Challenges for Software Engineering. As there are studies claiming that owning an Apple iPhone is now a common sign of wealth, we are interested in exploring user price sensitivity and their income level across different app stores. Considering the discrepancy between the actual number of users for each app store, we measure the proportion of different user type in the following analysis. In our analysis, we classify respondents who chose price as a main factor influencing app download decision as price-sensitive and the rest as not sure. The bar chart below demonstrates the proportion of price-sensitive and non-price-sensitive (not sure) user for each app store. The proportion of price-sensitive user is 20% higher for Apple iOS and Blackberry, implying that user purchasing behaviors for these two app stores are more likely to be affected by product price. As Android and Apple iOS are the two most used app store, we narrow our focus to these two app stores and further explore their user income level distribution. Taking into account of socioeconomic development across countries and different currency exchange rate, Lim et al. divide income level into 11 groups while designing the questionnaire: higher group number represents higher the income level. The proportion of Apple user rises along with income level while the proportion of Android user shows an inverse pattern: the proportion of Apple user is approximately 20% higher in level 11, and the proportion of Android user is about 60% higher in level 1. Considering the massive global market share of Android and local brand dominance (e.g. Apple has market share lead over Android in North America), we create a bar char of user proportions for Android and iOS faceting by user nationality to investigate whether user income pattern is a global trend. Potentially due to Apples brand power and brand awareness, in most North American countries, there are clusters of iOS users in higher income level, while in European countries, the pattern is less lopsided. On the other hand, Android user dominates all income groups in countries such as India, Russia, and South Korea since in those countries brands such as Samsung and Xiaomi have a higher brand awareness. 5.2 Analysis 2 The gender of respondents is approximately evenly distributed between male and female, and a large number of people didnt specify their gender. Therefore, we will ignore those users in our following analysis about gender-neutral app categories and their relationships to user demographic information such as age, nationality, and educational background. To find gender-neutral app categories, we first calculate the difference between the number of male user and female user for each app category. If the number of male user is greater than the number of female user, then the category is classified as male-dominated category with a magnitude measured by the absolute value of the difference. We define female-dominated category in a similar fashion. The categories are then sorted by magnitude in ascending order, with more gender-neutral categories showing up on top and more gender-dominated categories at the bottom. We pick the top 4 most gender-neutral categories and analyze the distribution of user demographic data in the following section. 5.2.1 Gender-neutral categories and their relationships to user demographic information As the number of users across countries varies, we compute the percentage of users for each gender-neutral category within each country. Clearly, music app has gain popularity from both male and female users regardless of nationality. The pattern of user proportion by category is almost the same except for France and Germany. The second most popular gender-neutral category is Catalogues in France and Reference in Germany. Users from India are more likely to download educational apps compared with users from other countries. Cultural difference certainly plays an important role, and developers face the challenge of incorporating insights from countries and cultural differences in feature selection for their apps. The distribution of age is approximately the same for all gender-neutral categories, and Music and Education attract more younger users. There are new perspectives regarding continuing education, and a small number of respondents claimed they have 80 years of education. However, for analysis purpose, we consider those responses as outlier and remove them using \\(\\pm 1.5\\times IQR\\) as the threshold. The distribution of years of education also show similar pattern across categories. 5.3 Analysis 3 5.3.1 Income Distribution of Price-sensitive Users Here we are going to analyze the incomes based on the pre-divided intervals as well. Incomes are displayed in order of highest to lowest level on the y-axis (from top to bottom). For uses in the North America, there are similar distributions (close to normal) for CAD (Canada Dollar) and USD (US Dollar), while Mexican incomes appear to be more evenly distributed. CNY (Chinese Yuan) users incomes are clustered in a higher level. Incomes in JPY (Japanese Yen) mainly range from level 3 to 8, with no data in the highest level of 10 and 11. Most of the Korean respondents seem to be students from our guess since lots of them earn the lowest level of income. In Europe and other continents, number of the price-sensitive using EUR and BRL (Brazilian Real) appears to be larger than other countries and most observations are clustered under level 5, but for INR (Indian Rupee), there are more people having higher incomes. Overall we can see that income distributions differ a lot in each country. 5.3.2 Reasons why people download apps they spent on For both types of users, many answered game(s) (angry birds in particular) and an upgrade of pro version as the reasons why they downloaded the apps that they had in-app purchase in. Price-sensitive users (word cloud on the left) also spent money on zombie type of mobile games. Another obvious pattern for the price-sensitive is that they cant remember the reasons for downloading apps but they do remember theyve spent money on those apps. In the meanwhile, people that are not as price-sensitive (word cloud on the right) purchased google and office products essential for business or study. 5.3.3 Why did people pay? Most people do not pay for apps. Among users who spend on apps, many chose No similar free app, For additional features or contents in a paid app and For features in an initially free app as the top reasons why they purchase. Another interesting reason is that people think paid apps have better quality/more features than free apps in general. These popular reasons would be a great guidance for app developers: they should at least meet the user expectation that the apps cost more must have more features or quality contents available. In addition, price-sensitive users usually pay for an app when it is on sale. So sales promotions are a good choice for developers to pitch their apps to potential users.

With a rapidly increasing number of apps, software developers face the challenge of satisfying consumers ever-rising and changing expectations. In this project, we narrow our focus on Android and Apple iOS, the two most used app store worldwide, and mainly investigate user price sensitivity and user income distribution for these two app stores across countries. We show that while owning an iPhone seems to be a strong indicator of higher income, this is more likely to be a geo-specific trend in North America given Apples brand power, and Android app store gains dominance in countries such as India, South Korea, and Russia. In the second part, we focus on analysis about gender-neutral categories and explore the distribution of user demographic information such as age, nationality, and years of education. While we do observe some cultural difference in downloads for gender-neutral categories, user persona in terms of age and educational background for gender-neutral apps are very similar in general. Then we take a step further to investigate the price-sensitive users. The income distributions appear to be very different in each country or continent due to the random survey. In details, the visualization shows that there are a large number of student respondents in countries like Korea and Brazil, while incomes in Canada, United States and Great Britain are more normally distributed. We also use the word clouds of price-sensitive vs non-sensitive users to present reasons why people download apps that they spend money on. Price-sensitive users mainly recall their purchase experiences with games such as Angry Birds and Zombies as well as pro version of applications. If we look at the specific reasons why price-sensitive people pay for apps, the most popular choices are Cant find a free app with similar features and App is on sale. As expected, sales promotion plays an important role in the ways that developers attract more users. Another significant finding is that many people spend on apps because they believe Paid apps have better quality/more features than free apps in general. Mobile app developers should start with improving their contents and features to meet consumers expectation to stand out in such a competitive market. Aside from our findings, there is still room to improve. Since the data is collected through a questionnaire, answers could be subjective to personal experience and cultural background. Besides, since almost all of the attributes we have are categorical variables, the type of data exploratory analysis we can apply is limited and the published dataset omits respondents annual income, a key factor influencing user behavior, due to privacy concerns. Therefore, we cant build models such as regression models, which potentially enable us to get more insights of relationships between variables and predict future trends. Lastly, the survey collected data across 15 countries, and some questions collect text responses. At this point, we mainly focus on answers with hard-coded choice or are typed in English. In the future, we can incorporate techniques from NLP to extract additional information to get a more comprehensive picture.
